Welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. student studying both computer and cognitive science at the University of Michigan. I am co-advised by Professors [Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/) and [Honglak Lee](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/). I aim to computationally model the reasoning processes and memory systems that enable humans to learn from direct instruction and small amounts of experience. 

# Curriculum Vitae
Here is a [link to my curriculum vitae](https://jhsansom.github.io/files/JakeSansom_CV.pdf). (Last updated November 2025)

# Highlights

- My current project, focused on evaluating LLMs' ability to learn via naturalistic interactions with human users, was recently accepted into the NeurIPS 2025 [Workshop on Multi-Turn Interactions in LLMs](https://workshop-multi-turn-interaction.github.io/). I plan to release a preprint soon!
- [[Paper Link](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.994.pdf)] I helped publish a paper in ACL 2025 that utilizes Read-Eval-Print Loops (REPLs) to structure LLM planning on a variety of domains.
- [[Paper Link](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.72.pdf)] I helped publish a paper at EMNLP 2023 on LLMs' capacity for Theory of Mind (reasoning about the mental states of others).

# Brief Biography

I was born in Austin, TX, raised in Birmingham, AL, and subsequently returned to Texas to attend the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) (Hook'em Horns!). While there, I studied [computational engineering](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/undergraduate/computational-undergrad-program/what-is-computational-engineering), a degree program focused on numerical methods for the simulation of physical phenomena. Under the tutelage of [Dr. Michael Sacks](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Michael-Sacks/) at the [Willerson Center for Cardiovascular Modeling and Simulation](https://wccms.oden.utexas.edu), I spent two years developing computational models of heart tissue. Meanwhile, I began to cultivate a deep interest in cognitive science. I participated in the [Polymathic Scholars Honors Program](https://cns.utexas.edu/honors/honors-programs-center/polymathic), which enabled me to hand-design a field of study which I called "Architecture of the Mind." This work culminated in my [senior thesis](https://jhsansom.github.io/files/JakeSansom_Thesis.pdf), which I wrote under the advice of [Dr. Michael Mauk](https://clm.utexas.edu/faculty/dr-michael-mauk/). After college I spent two years in San Diego, CA working for [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com). While there, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of products, most of which leveraged my knowledge of digital signal processing. In September of 2022, I decided to return both to school and to my love of cognitive science to obtain my master's degree in computer science from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu). I am now pursuing both a Ph.D. in computer science and a certificate in cognitive science.

When not working, I enjoy staying active by running and cycling.
