I am an aspiring computational cognitive scientist and a current master's student in computer science at the University of Michigan.

This website is currently a work in progress. Until it is more organized, here is a link to my [curriculum vitae](https://jhsansom.github.io/files/JakeSansom_CV.pdf).

# Research

I aim to study intelligence by combining insights from computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Various capabilities are hallmarks of intelligence (e.g., the use of language). I aim to (1) identify and model these hallmark capabilities at a high level and (2) engineer algorithms that possess these capabilities. By doing so, I hope to simultaneously construct more effective AI systems while also gaining insights into the structure of biological cognition.

In particular, I am interested in the methods by which humans continuously adapt to the ever-evolving real world. This capability seems to involve a number of sub-capabilities:
- Humans can extract generalized world knowledge from specific events. This "generalized world knowledge" is stored in **semantic memory**, whereas knowledge of "specific events" is stored in **episodic memory**. The process by which semantic memories are created from episodic memories is termed **consolidation**. How do humans determine the proper **level of abstraction** for creating these semantic memories?
- Humans can effectively use both episodic and semantic memories for cognitive control. This presumably involves **reasoning** and **planning** (two types of mental computations) that use these memories. Can we derive an algorithm capable of similar reasoning and planning processes?
- Humans can rapidly learn from linguistic descriptions of the world. **Language** enables the transmission of knowledge expressed at arbitrary levels of abstraction. How does the structure of human memory and mental computations enable a faculty for language?

# Brief Biography

I was born in Austin, TX, raised in Birmingham, AL, and subsequently returned to Texas to attend the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) (Hook'em Horns!). While there, I studied [computational engineering](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/undergraduate/computational-undergrad-program/what-is-computational-engineering), a degree program focused on numerical methods for the simulation of physical phenomena. Under the tutelage of [Dr. Michael Sacks](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Michael-Sacks/) at the [Willerson Center for Cardiovascular Modeling and Simulation](https://wccms.oden.utexas.edu), I spent two years developing computational models of heart tissue. Meanwhile, I began to cultivate a deep interest in cognitive science. I participated in the [Polymathic Scholars Honors Program](https://cns.utexas.edu/honors/honors-programs-center/polymathic), which enabled me to hand-design a field of study which I called "Architecture of the Mind." This work culminated in my [senior thesis](https://jhsansom.github.io/files/JakeSansom_Thesis.pdf), which I wrote under the advice of [Dr. Michael Mauk](https://clm.utexas.edu/faculty/dr-michael-mauk/). After college I spent two years in San Diego, CA working for [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com). While there, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of products, most of which leveraged my knowledge of digital signal processing. In September of 2022, I decided to return both to school and to my love of cognitive science to obtain my master's degree in computer science from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu). I am currently doing research within the [Situated Language and Embodied Dialogue Lab](https://sled.eecs.umich.edu) under the tutelage of [Dr. Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/).

When not working, I enjoy getting outside by running and cycling. I am also a mediocre pianist and an even worse cook.
