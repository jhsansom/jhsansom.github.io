I am an aspiring computational cognitive scientist interested primarily in working and declarative memory. I currently do research in embodied AI, a field which I believe employs an empirical paradigm conducive for the study of cognition.

This website is currently a work in progress. Until it is more organized, here is a link to my [curriculum vitae](https://jhsansom.github.io/files/JakeSansom_CV.pdf). Additionally, here is a link to my [undergraduate thesis](https://jhsansom.github.io/files/JakeSansom_Thesis.pdf), in which I utilized process philosophy to critique purely symbolic models of human working memory. 

# Current Research

My latest research project is motivated by Lev Vygotsky's Social Interactionist Theory, which argues that children initially develop mental functions (including a command of language) through social interaction. Only later do they become adept at performing these functions on their own. In contrast, the current NLP paradigm does not typically emphasize social interaction as a method for language acquisition. My research team is working to bridge this gap by developing an experiment that requires the agent to acquire language by interacting with a knowledgable teacher in an embodied environment.

# Brief Biography

I was born in Austin, TX, raised in Birmingham, AL, and subsequently returned to Texas to attend the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) (Hook'em Horns!). While there, I studied [computational engineering](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/undergraduate/computational-undergrad-program/what-is-computational-engineering), a degree program focused on numerical methods for the simulation of physical phenomena. Under the tutelage of [Dr. Michael Sacks](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Michael-Sacks/) at the [Willerson Center for Cardiovascular Modeling and Simulation](https://wccms.oden.utexas.edu), I spent two years developing computational models of heart tissue. Meanwhile, I began to cultivate a deep interest in cognitive science. I participated in the [Polymathic Scholars Honors Program](https://cns.utexas.edu/honors/honors-programs-center/polymathic), which enabled me to hand-design a field of study which I called "Architecture of the Mind." This work culminated in my [senior thesis](https://jhsansom.github.io/files/JakeSansom_Thesis.pdf), which I wrote under the advice of [Dr. Michael Mauk](https://clm.utexas.edu/faculty/dr-michael-mauk/). After college I spent two years in San Diego, CA working for [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com). While there, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of products, most of which leveraged my knowledge of digital signal processing. In September of 2022, I decided to return both to school and to my love of cognitive science to obtain my master's degree in computer science from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu). I am currently doing research within the [Situated Language and Embodied Dialogue Lab](https://sled.eecs.umich.edu) under the tutelage of [Dr. Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/).

When not working, I enjoy getting outside by running, cycling, and (formerly) surfing. I am also a mediocre pianist and an even worse cook.
